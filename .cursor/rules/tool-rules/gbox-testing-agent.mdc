# Gbox APK-Testing Rule

## Critical Rules
- After creating or starting a Gbox Android box, open its live-view URL (`open_live_view`) in the default browser immediately.
- Compute the absolute path of `./chat-droid/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` (e.g. `/Users/jack/workspace/geoquiz/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`) and pass that to `install_apk`.
- Wait for successful installation before launching or opening the app.
- If multiple boxes are running, operate only on the box created for the current test session.

## Examples
<example>
✅ Correct Flow
1. Create Android box → obtain `boxId`.
2. Open live-view for `boxId`.
3. Install APK with absolute path `/abs/path/to/repo/geoquiz/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.
4. Launch the app.
5. Use the ai_action tool to perform UI actions.
6. Keep reviewing the screenshots after the operation to determine if it is as expected.
7. Keep action-review loop until all test done.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
❌ Forgetting to open the live-view URL.
❌ Passing the relative APK path `./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` to `install_apk`.
